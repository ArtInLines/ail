- Simple C-based Build System
  - Provide ability to run commands like bash/batch scripts
  - Allow parallelization of builds
  - Provide thin abstraction layer over different C compilers
  - Inspired by tsoding's nob: https://github.com/tsoding/musializer/blob/master/src/nob.h
- Sized Array template like AIL_DA
- Dynamic Array that doesn't invalidate indexes template
  - needs some name - doesn't seem to have one (except for jdah's 'blklist')
  - can be implemented with pointer invalidation or without (i.e. normal resizing or with linked-list regions)
  - needs to store free indexes (either via a freelist or bitmaps)
  - Implemented with freelists before in Odin (called PersonManger here): https://github.com/ArtInLines/famtree/blob/master/model.odin
  - jdah implemented it with bitmaps here: https://github.com/jdah/ld55/blob/main/cjam/util/blklist.h
- interned strings cache library
- portable simd library
- portable thread library
- portable subprocess library
- linear algebra library
- dynamic reloading library (maybe?) (see: https://github.com/jdah/ld55/blob/main/cjam/reloadhost/reloadhost.h)
- improve AIL_HM
- fix errors in allocators
- change allocator interface to use a single function with an enum determining the action (alloc/free/etc.) -> requires less space (same as Odin's implementation of allocators)
- bc of IMPL_GUARDS, requiring to define IMPL for every library is kinda dumb -> change this
- Formatting/Printing for ail_sv.h
- Visualization of allocations in ail_alloc.h for debugging memory bugs
