# ail

A modern Standard Library for C with a focus on usability, portability and performance.

Since this library does not rely on C's standard library, it should work on all platforms including WASM and embedded environments.

## Disclaimer

This library is still heavily under development as I experiment with using it in my own projects. Many features are not implemented yet, there is very little documentation and breaking changes might be introduced at any point.

It is not recommended to use this library for production yet.

All libraries are written in C11 (often even C99). C++ portability is not a high priority right now.

## Structure

The structure of the library is explained in [src/README.md](./src/README.md)

## Conventions

TBD

## Notes on Generic Data Structures

TBD

## Why is it named 'ail'?

It's the shortform for my github name [ArtInLines](https://github.com/ArtInLines).
